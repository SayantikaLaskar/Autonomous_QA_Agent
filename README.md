# Autonomous QA Agent for Test Case and Script Generation

A production-ready QA automation system that transforms project documentation into comprehensive test suites. The agent intelligently processes support documents to generate grounded test cases and executable Selenium scripts, eliminating manual test writing while ensuring complete coverage based on actual requirements.

## Core Capabilities

- **Multi-format Document Processing** - Supports Markdown, TXT, JSON, and PDF files
- **Vector-based Knowledge Retrieval** - ChromaDB-powered semantic search for accurate context retrieval
- **Grounded Test Generation** - AI-powered test case creation strictly based on provided documentation
- **Executable Script Generation** - Converts test cases to production-ready Selenium Python scripts
- **RESTful API Backend** - FastAPI-based service architecture with comprehensive documentation
- **Interactive Web Interface** - Streamlit-powered UI for seamless workflow management

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`

## Quick Start

1. **Navigate to project directory**
```bash
cd qa-agent
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application**
```bash
python start_app.py
```

4. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:8501

*Note: Required AI models will download automatically on first use.*

## Running the Application

```bash
python start_app.py
```

This single command starts both the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend automatically.

### Access the Application
- **Main Interface**: http://localhost:8501 (Streamlit UI)
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs (FastAPI docs)/docs

## Usage Workflow

### Document Ingestion
Upload support documents including specifications, UI guidelines, API documentation, and business requirements. The system accepts multiple formats and processes them into a searchable knowledge base.

### Knowledge Base Construction
The system chunks documents, generates semantic embeddings, and stores them in a vector database for intelligent retrieval during test generation.

### Test Case Generation
Query the system with natural language requests such as "Generate test cases for form validation" or "Create tests for payment processing workflow". The agent retrieves relevant documentation context and generates comprehensive test scenarios.

The system uses advanced AI models when available for higher-fidelity test generation, with automatic fallback to rule-based generation ensuring the system works reliably in all environments.

### Script Generation
Select generated test cases to convert into executable Selenium Python scripts. The system analyzes your HTML structure and creates scripts with accurate element selectors and proper assertions.

### Execution and Integration
Generated scripts are ready for immediate execution or integration into existing CI/CD pipelines and test automation frameworks.

## Sample Implementation

### Target Web Application
The repository includes a complete e-commerce checkout implementation (`checkout.html`) featuring:
- Product catalog with cart management
- Form validation and error handling
- Payment processing workflow
- Responsive design patterns

### Documentation Suite
Five comprehensive support documents demonstrate real-world usage:

| Document | Purpose | Content |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `product_specs.md` | Feature Specifications | Business rules, discount logic, shipping calculations |
| `ui_ux_guide.txt` | Interface Guidelines | Validation rules, error messaging, accessibility requirements |
| `api_endpoints.json` | Technical Specifications | REST API contracts, request/response schemas |
| `business_requirements.md` | Functional Requirements | User stories, acceptance criteria, business logic |
| `test_scenarios.md` | Quality Assurance | Edge cases, boundary conditions, regression scenarios |

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Services
- **FastAPI Framework**: High-performance async API with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Vector database for semantic document retrieval
- **Sentence Transformers**: State-of-the-art embedding models for text encoding
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns for document processing, knowledge management, and generation

### Frontend Interface  
- **Streamlit Framework**: Interactive web interface with real-time feedback
- **File Upload Handling**: Multi-format document processing with progress indicators
- **Code Display**: Syntax-highlighted script output with copy functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Cross-platform compatibility and mobile support

### Data Processing
- **Document Parsing**: Intelligent text extraction preserving structure and metadata
- **Chunking Strategy**: Context-aware segmentation optimized for retrieval accuracy
- **Embedding Generation**: Transformer-based vector representations for semantic search
- **Metadata Management**: Source tracking and provenance for generated content

## Configuration and Deployment

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended for large document sets)
- Internet connection for initial model downloads
- Available ports 8000 (FastAPI) and 8501 (Streamlit)

### Environment Configuration
The application automatically manages dependencies and model downloads. For production deployments, consider:
